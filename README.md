Project Title: Penguins Wars

Overview:
Penguins Wars is a digital adaptation of the fast-paced tabletop strategy game, "That's My Fish!".  Leveraging the Unity game engine and the PUN 2 (Photon Unity Networking) library, this project transforms the tabletop experience into a seamless online multiplayer environment.  My goal was to explore the intricacies of turn-based multiplayer development, focusing on state synchronization and player matchmaking.

Key Features:

- Recreation of Core Mechanics: All Mechanics of the original game tile game have been implemeted, and are in full working order.

- Multiplayer Framework: PUN 2 integration enables real-time matches, ensuring that player actions and board state changes are reflected accurately for all participants.

- Turn Based Game: The strategic depth of "That's My Fish!" is retained, with players carefully planning their moves to maximize fish collection and outwit their opponents.
